## Introduction
In my relative short stint at [open ended learning environments lab](https://wp0.vanderbilt.edu/oele/) at Vanderbilt University, I quickly found that although learning science research and the core concepts are way above my paygrade, and something that I am not particularly interested in. However, there as with any research domain, there are various aspects in which richer computer science theory / tooling can not only streamline the processes in a domain, but also provide richer context and evidences to support / disregard what are the core theories in any domain.

But even before that, my current role came into existence followed by an unfortunate end to a previous [DARPA project](https://github.com/symbench) and thanks to the [NSF Engage AI institute](https://engageai.org) for investing in a Multimodal learning analytics strand, for which I was hired to develop and test platform and infrastructure for collecting and analysis of multimodal data for education. This was my initial days of foraying into multi-media streaming.
